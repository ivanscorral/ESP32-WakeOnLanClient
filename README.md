# MiniWakeOnLanClient

## Summary

ESP32 based minimalistic low power consumption WOL packet sender server.
It can be used to power up a server remotely acting as a middle man between the router and the server.
This serves as a great low power alternative to a similar setup using a standalone computer or a Raspberry Pi.
